[SIZE="4"][B]What is Ion26?[/B][/SIZE]
Ion26 is an habbo emulator based on ION/Deltar made by [B][U]Nillus[/U][/B]. The habbo version Ion26 will be made for, is r26.
It is written in C#.NET and uses MySQL as database. The developer of this emulator is me, awa500, but its open-source so everybody can help developing!
I'm making this emulator because i'm tired of Holograph Emulator, and i want to make something new, better and faster.
